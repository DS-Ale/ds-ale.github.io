  #### Overview
  Development of a 3D top-down shooter game for an University project, using Unity engine.
  
  #### Specifics
  We will impersonate a Scavenger, a person who travels in search of abandoned structures
  to retrieve wreckage and valuables, but this time she gets stuck inside a spaceship soon
  after docking.
  In addition to the use of firearms, she will have the opportunity to learn certain powers
  (Skills) that will be performed by Nanites (Nanorobots) that she will accumulate during the
  journey, producing "magical" effects.

  #### Overview
  Development of a 3D configurator in WebGL for clothing products, developed using the
  Unity engine and a Test-Driven development approach. Made for my Masterâ€™s Degree
  Thesis.
  
  #### Specifics
  The aim of this application was to create a 3D configurator that could run on common
  browsers, in order to customize 3D models by modifying materials, textures and colors.
  For this purpose, Asset Bundles were used, which made it possible to add/remove/change
  the available models without having to build the entire application.
  In addition, textures are loaded from an external source, so that they can be managed without modifying anything
  on the application side. For some models a physical simulation is also available.
  
  As a side project, a Virtual Try On was also developed as a desktop application, using an
  available pre-trained neural network model and a common webcam.

  #### Overview
  Development of a 2D top-down shooter game for an (group) University project, using bare Java.
  
  #### Specifics
  The game is an Arcade tactical shooter with a top-down view.

  The player's objective will be to reach a goal, located at the end of the level opposite the starting box, by surviving enemy attacks.
  There are three difficulty levels available, four types of weapons, two powerups and a level editor.
