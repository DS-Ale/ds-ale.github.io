## ML & Data Science

- ### [2024] [Diamonds Price Estimation üíé](https://github.com/DS-Ale/diamonds-price-estimation)
  <img src="images/diamond.png?raw=true"/>

  #### Overview
  Personal project aimed to predict the price of a diamond, based on its characteristics.

  #### Specifics
  Modeling of a Jupyter Notebook, following the main phases of the CRISP-DM methodology. Model deployment and API building via small webapp made in Flask.

  #### Tools
  _Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Flask_

- ### [2021] [Diabetes Hospital Readmission üè•](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1atji4Lg2bZMVISs-bnhfdF3mTB1Xs8cp)

  #### Overview
  Group University project aimed to predict whether or not a diabetic patient will be readmitted within 30 days of discharge.

  #### Specifics
  Modeling of a Jupyter Notebook, following the main phases of the CRISP-DM methodology, from Business Understanding to Model Evaluation.

  #### Tools
  _Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, Seaborn, Scikit-learn_

## GameDev & similar
- ### [2022] SCI-FC üëæ
  <img src="images/scifc.png?raw=true" width=600/>
  
  #### Overview
  Development of a 3D top-down shooter game for an University project, using Unity engine.
  
  #### Specifics
  The main goal of the project is to gain as much knowledge as possible about the Unity
  engine and the main approaches and "know-how" of Game Design. This implies
  interfacing with various horizontal knowledge, from Programming to Animation.
  
  Player can use various firearms, scattered across the levels, and special powers that can be
  activated using "Nanites" (Nanorobots).

  #### Materials
  - [Game Design Document w/ Development Details](/pdf/Sci-FC_GDD_en.pdf)
  
  #### Tools
  _C#, Unity_
  
- ### [2022] [DOUTFIT üëó](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D-aKbmgMVOHrAOA8DREXuFoKA41vDzVn)
  <img src="images/doutfit.png?raw=true" width=600/>
  
  #### Overview
  Development of a 3D configurator in WebGL for clothing products, developed using the
  Unity engine and a Test-Driven development approach. Made for my Master‚Äôs Degree
  Thesis.
  
  #### Specifics
  The aim of this application was to create a 3D configurator that could run on common
  browsers, in order to customize 3D models by modifying materials, textures and colors.
  For this purpose, Asset Bundles were used, which made it possible to add/remove/change
  the available models without having to build the entire application.
  In addition, textures are loaded from an external source, so that they can be managed without modifying anything
  on the application side. For some models a physical simulation is also available.
  
  As a side project, a Virtual Try On was also developed as a desktop application, using an
  available pre-trained neural network model and a common webcam.

  #### Tools
  _C#, Unity, Test-Driven Development, Neural Network_

  <img src="images/projectfc.jpg?raw=true" width=600/>
  <img src="images/projectfc-editor.jpg?raw=true" width=600/>
    
  #### Overview
  Development of a 2D top-down shooter game for a group University project, using bare Java.
  
  #### Specifics
  The game is an Arcade tactical shooter with a top-down view.

  The player's objective will be to reach a goal, located at the end of the level opposite the starting box, by surviving enemy attacks.
  There are three difficulty levels available, four types of weapons, two powerups and a level editor.

  #### Tools
  _Java, JavaFX, Java AWT/Swing_
